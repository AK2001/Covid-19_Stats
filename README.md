## This is a project undertaken by two second-year Computer Science undergraduates as part of a coursework for our Statistics course.<br>
This project utilizes `python 3`, more specifically the `pandas` package, and `jupyter notebooks` to perform a Statistical analysis on data from the recent and ongoing __COVID-19__ pandemic.<br>
The data was collected from this github [repo](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv). **Note:** Because this data is constantly refreshing, this project currently uses data from 2019-12-31 to 2020-11-24.<br><br>
In total, this project answers on eleven (11) statistical questions set by the Coursework Handout.
