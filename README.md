# This is a project undertaken by two second-year Computer Science undergraduates as part of a coursework for our Statistics course.<br>
This project uses `python 3` and `jupyter notebooks` to perform a Statistical analysis on data from the recent and ongoing __COVID-19__ pandemic.<br>
The data was collected from this github [source](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv). But because this data is constantly refreshing
this project currently uses data from 2019-12-31 to 2020-11-24.
